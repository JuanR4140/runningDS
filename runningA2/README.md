# running Alpha 2

August 20, 2023.

running alpha 2 release, a little better project wise. Added a lot more things compared to alpha 1.

Title, main menu, music, proper death, saving/loading, shop, bow & arrow.

Added what I wanted to add as a small little game. I might return for an alpha 3 or more if I'm bored one day :p.

Pretty good progress tho i think
