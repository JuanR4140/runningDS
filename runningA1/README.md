# running Alpha 1

March 20, 2023

This is an alpha 1 release for runningDS.

Very simple, with only sound effects, a few enemies, and a more than crude collision system. Grass blocks can also be generated anywhere, which means some may overlap.

This was more of a prototype than anything, having a poor file structure and just getting used to developing with libnds directly.
